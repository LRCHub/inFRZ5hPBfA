My stomach hurts I can't sleep
What the hell's inside of me
Makes me feel this way
Almost every day
Was it something I did as a hurtful kid?
My payback from way back?
It's the way that it goes

It's such a trip that I can hide how close I am to suicide
Get those records, that's what it's all about
There is nothing more that I can say
I'll save my life for a rainy day
I light a cigarette for all the regret

You're famous to me
You help me breath
You're famous to me
You're all that I need
