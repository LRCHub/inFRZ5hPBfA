I can tell
A hurtful kid
By the way
A hurtful kid
Switching on
A heartbreaker is stunned
Just because (a hurtful kid)
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid

My stomach hurts I can't sleep
What the hell's inside of me
Makes me feel this way
Almost every day
It's the way that it goes

It's such a trip that I can't hide
How close I am to suicide
Get those records out
That's what it's all about
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
It's the way that it goes

It's the way that it goes
It's the way that it goes
It's the way that it goes
It's the way that it goes
