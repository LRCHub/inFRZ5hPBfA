There were a few, but, I think
The most hurtful thing someone has ever said to me
And my mom said to me
Well, the earliest one
"I don't know what's wrong with me that I make children like this"
Was "I don't want you"
When I was in school I was told multiple
Times, as if it was a bad thing, that I was fat.
"I don't want you"
That I wasn't smart
And that was something I was told since I was really young
Um, I think the most hurtful thing
That somebody's ever said to me is probably
And that was used against me in a really negative way
My father once said to me is probably
And I was told I was ugly
Just kind of growing up in a really kind of Evangelical situation

That I looked like I was an old woman, that I would only get uglier.
That I was, yeah, all those things

Ever said to me was I don't want you.
I don't want you
And my mom said to me,

Don't quit your day job

Where I was told I would spend an eternity in
Hell if I didn't do some mysterious magical thing.
It was very, it was quite confusing at the time.
And, you know, it's still in there

I think the most hurtful thing anyone
Has ever said to me is that I am insane
Can you believe that
